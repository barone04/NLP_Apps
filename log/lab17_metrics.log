--- Performance Metrics ---
1. Data Reading Duration: 8.78 seconds
2. Pipeline Fitting (Training) Duration: 2.36 seconds
3. Data Transformation (Processing) Duration: 1.48 seconds
4. Vocabulary Calculation Duration: 0.46 seconds
Total documents processed: 2000 (out of 2000 requested)
Actual vocabulary size (after preprocessing): 48272 unique terms
HashingTF numFeatures set to: 20000
Vector Normalization: L2 (Euclidean) used.
Note: numFeatures (20000) is smaller than actual vocabulary size (48272). Hash collisions are expected.
